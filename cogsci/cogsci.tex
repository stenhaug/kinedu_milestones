\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

A child's development can be thought of as the set of developmental
milestones that they have reached at a particular point in time. This
conceptualization results in data with the same structure as the item
response data common to educational measurement. In education, item
response data is most typically students responding to test items (i.e.,
questions) and, in the dichotomous case, getting each question either
correct or incorrect. In the context of child development, the child is
the ``student,'' and each developmental milestone is the ``item.''

We use Kinedu, a Mexico-based child development app, as a source for
this type of data. When parents first start using the Kinedu app, they
are asked a series of questions about which developmental milestones
their child has reached. We consider the 1946 children between 2 and 55
months of age whose parents responded to all 414 of the developmental
milestones. Each developmental miletone on Kinedu is mapped to a
milestone group: physical, cognitive, linguistic, or social \&
emotional. Table 1 shows the number of developmental milestones in each
group along with an example milestone in Spanish (as its shown to the
parent) and its translation in English.

Figure 1 shows the age (in months) and number of developmental
milestones for each child. As can be seen in Figure 1, at 12 months of
age, most children have reached about 200 developmental milestones. At
24 months of age, most children have reached about 300 developmental
milestones. Finally, at 48 months of age, most children have reached
about 375 of the 414 developmental milestones.

\section{Empirical assessment of the dimensionality of child
development}\label{empirical-assessment-of-the-dimensionality-of-child-development}}

We frame the assessment of the dimensionality of child development as a
model comparison question.

\hypertarget{models}{%
\subsection{Models}\label{models}}

Item response theory offers a suite of models with which to model item
response data. We adopt the notation used in Chalmers \& others (2012).
Let \(i = 1, \ldots, I\) represent the distinct children and
\(j = 1, \ldots, J\) the developmental milestones. The Kinedu item
response data is stored in a matrix, \(y\), where element \(y_{ij}\)
denotes if the \(i\)th child has or has not achieved the \(j\)th
developmental milestone as reported by their parent/guardian. Each model
represents the \(i\)th child's development using \(m\) latent factors
\(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{i}=(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_m)\). The \(j\)th
milestone's discriminations (i.e.~slopes)
\(\boldsymbol{a_j}=(a_1, \dots, a_m)\) capture the latent factor
loadings onto that milestone.

We fit four two-parametric logistic (2PL) models where a child's
development is represented by \(m = 1, m = 2, m = 3,\) and \(m = 4\)
latent factors. According to the 2PL model, the probability of a child
having achieved a developmental milestone is \[
P(y_{ij} = 1 | \boldsymbol{\theta_i}, \boldsymbol{a_j}, b_j) = \sigma(\boldsymbol{a}_{j}^{\top}\boldsymbol{\theta_i} + b_j)
\] where \(b_j\) is the milestone easiness (i.e.~intercept) and
\(\sigma(x) = \frac{e^x}{e^x + 1}\) is the standard logistic function.

The 2PL models learn the latent factor structure entirely from the data,
making them exploratory. The bifactor model offers an alternative
specification where each milestone loads onto a general factor
\(\theta_0\) and a specific factor \(\theta_s\). The assignment of each
developmental milestone to its specific factor is an opportunity to
specify the latent factor structure, making the model confirmatory as
opposed to exploratory. We map each milestone to its specific factor
according to the four developmental milestone groups shown in Table X.
For the bifactor model, the probability of a child having achieved a
developmental milestone is \[
P(y_{ij} = 1 | \theta_0, \theta_s, a_0, a_s) = \sigma(a_0\theta_0 + a_s\theta_s + b_j).
\]

\hypertarget{model-comparison}{%
\subsection{Model comparison}\label{model-comparison}}

Model comparison in IRT typically uses information criterion such as AIC
and BIC (Maydeu-Olivares, 2013). However, these methods are not
guaranteed to work at modest sample sizes (McDonald \& Mok, 1995).
Instead, we prefer a marginalized version of cross-validation. In
essence, we partition the data into folds based on the children
(i.e.~the rows of the item response matrix). Then for each fold, we
estimate the item parameters using all but that fold, and calculate the
likelihood of that fold by integrating over \(g(\theta)\).

Mathematically and following notation similar to Vehtari, Gelman, \&
Gabry (2017), we partition the data into \(K\) subsets \(y^{(k)}\) for
\(k = 1, \ldots, K\). Each model is fit separately to each training set
\(y^{(-k)}\) yielding item parameter estimates which we compactly denote
\(\boldsymbol{\Psi}^{(-k)}\). The predictive (i.e.~out-of-sample)
likelihood of \(y^{(k)}\) is

\[
p(y^{(k)} | y^{(-k)}) = \prod_{i \in i^{(k)}}^{I} \int_\theta \prod_{j=1}^{J} \hat{\text{Pr}}(y_{ij}^{(k)} | \Psi_j^{(-k)}, \theta) g(\theta)d\theta.
\]

The ultimate quantity of interest for each model is the log predictive
likelihood for the entire item response matrix, which is defined as

\[
\text{lpl } y = \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \log p(y^{(k)} | y^{(-k)}).
